	<h2> What is The GIPHY API? </h2>
	<p> Good question! But first, you're probably wondering what GIPHY is. Giphy is essentially a searchable database for gifs. When visiting the site, a user can either search for a gif or can upload their own gif, making it available and discoverable to other users of the site. The Giphy API is just an interface that leverages that same database. Utilizing a "Rest-like interface", the Giphy API takes HTTP and HTTPS queries and returns a list of gifs that meet the specifications of said query. Now, if any of those words seemed unfamiliar, don't worry! It's not nearly as complicated as it might sound. Soon enough, you too will be able to get any gif through this API and format it to your liking. Trust me, </p>
